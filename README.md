### Core Data Structures

**Task Definition (Your Mission Parameters):**
```go
type Task struct {
    ID          string
    Type        TaskType  // CPU_INTENSIVE, IO_BOUND, TIME_BASED
    Payload     json.RawMessage
    Priority    int
    CreatedAt   time.Time
    Timeout     time.Duration
}

type TaskResult struct {
    TaskID      string

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation - "Boot Camp" (Week 1-2)
**Objective:** Build the core concurrent engine with bulletproof basics

#### Phase 1.1: Core Engine Setup

  - Thread-safe task submission
  - Basic task types: CPU, I/O, Time-based
  - FIFO processing with overflow protection

#### Phase 1.2: Worker Pool Architecture
- **Worker Pool Pattern**
  - Configurable worker count (start with 3-5 workers)
  - Each worker: unique ID, dedicated goroutine, task processing loop
  - Shared task channel, individual result channels
  - Worker lifecycle management (startup, processing, shutdown)

#### Phase 1.3: Basic Task Types
1. **CPU-Intensive Tasks**
   - Prime number calculation (great for benchmarking)
   - Fibonacci sequence generation
   - Hash computations (SHA256 of random data)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Guide

### Essential Go Packages & Patterns

#### Concurrency Toolkit
```go
// Worker Pool Pattern - Your bread and butter
func NewWorkerPool(size int, taskChan <-chan Task) *WorkerPool {
    // Implementation strategy:
    // 1. Create worker goroutines with unique IDs
    // 2. Each worker runs infinite select loop
    // 3. Handle graceful shutdown via context
    // 4. Implement work-stealing for load balancing
}

// Channel Communication Patterns
taskQueue := make(chan Task, 100)        // Buffered for throughput
results := make(chan TaskResult, 50)     // Collect completed work
shutdown := make(chan struct{})          // Coordination signal
```

#### Critical Synchronization Patterns
- **sync.WaitGroup** - Coordinate goroutine completion
- **context.Context** - Cancellation and timeout management
- **sync.RWMutex** - Protect shared metrics and state
- **atomic operations** - Lock-free counters and flags

#### HTTP & Web Integration
```go
// Gorilla Mux for advanced routing
router := mux.NewRouter()
router.HandleFunc("/api/tasks", handleTaskSubmission).Methods("POST")

// Middleware patterns for logging, CORS, rate limiting
router.Use(loggingMiddleware, recoveryMiddleware)
```
